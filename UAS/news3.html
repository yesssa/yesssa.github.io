              Manchester United suffered another humbling home defeat as neighbours Manchester City
              outclassed them in a 2-0 Premier League win that ratcheted the pressure back up on manager
              Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Old Trafford on Saturday. Solskjaer's side never looked like being
              buried as they were in a 5-0 loss to Liverpool a fortnight ago but the defeat was just as 
              hard to stomach for the home fans, thousands of whom headed for the exits before the end.
              A seventh-minute own goal by United defender Eric Bailly gave City a dream start and they 
              doubled their advantage just before halftime when Bernardo Silva poked home from close range.

              City won at a canter and enjoyed a bonus as league leaders Chelsea were held to a 1-1 draw 
              at home to lowly Burnley. Chelsea lead the standings with 26 points, three ahead of City, 
              while Liverpool can close to within a point if they win at fourth-placed West Ham United 
              on Sunday. United's 3-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur last weekend relieved some of the pressure 
              on Solskjaer although they were fortunate to get a 2-2 draw away to Atalanta in midweek courtesy 
              of Cristiano Ronaldo's last-gasp equaliser. There was no salvation on Saturday though and Solskjaer 
              cut a sombre figure in the rain. "Of course it's very disappointing," Solskjaer said. "It's a 
              big step backwards, it is a way of losing that we don't like.

              Norwich City enjoyed a first league win of the season as they hung on for a 2-1 victory at 
              Brentford but it was not enough to keep coach Daniel Farke in his job. Hours after Canaries 
              fans celebrated in west London, news broke that Farke had left the club after four-and-a-half 
              years. "I know how determined Daniel and his staff were to succeed at this level, but we feel 
              that now is the right time for a change to give ourselves the best opportunity of retaining our 
              Premier League status," sporting director Stuart Webber said in a club statement. Norwich briefly 
              climbed off the bottom of the table but ended the day back in 20th spot as Newcastle United drew 
              1-1 at Brighton and Hove Albion.
