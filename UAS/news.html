              Russia has been stripped of hosting the men's Volleyball World Championships
              in August and September due to its invasion of Ukraine, governing body the
              International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) announced on Tuesday. The championships
              are the latest major sporting event to be taken away from Russia since President
              Vladimir Putin launched the invasion last Thursday. "Following Russia's military
              invasion of Ukraine, the FIVB remains gravely concerned by the escalating situation
              and for the safety of the people of Ukraine," said the International Volleyball
              Federation in a statement. "The FIVB Board of Administration has come to the
              conclusion that it would be impossible to prepare and stage the World Championships
              in Russia due to the war in Ukraine," the statement added.
            </p>

              "It has accordingly decided to remove from Russia the organisation of the FIVB
              Volleyball Men's World Championship scheduled to be held in August and September
              2022," it concluded. The federation's decision follows European football's governing 
              body UEFA announcement last Friday to switch the May 28 final of The Champions League, 
              their premier club competition, from The Gazprom Arena in Saint Petersburg to the Stade de France in Paris. 
              Formula One on Friday also cancelled the Russian Grand Prix scheduled for September 25.
